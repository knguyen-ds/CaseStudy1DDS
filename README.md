# CaseStudy1DDS
# Executive Summary

## Company Overview
DDSAnalytics specializes in providing talent management solutions for Fortune 100 companies, focusing on enhancing employee development and retention. As part of its strategic initiative to gain a competitive edge, the company plans to leverage data science to improve talent management practices, with an initial emphasis on predicting employee turnover.

## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze existing employee data to identify key factors influencing employee attrition. This analysis will serve as a foundation for developing predictive models aimed at reducing attrition, ultimately enhancing workforce stability and productivity.

## Data Analysis Approach
Our data science team will utilize the provided dataset (CaseStudy1-data.csv) to thoroughly examine employee attributes and attrition rates. The analysis will identify the top three factors contributing to attrition, supported by robust statistical evidence. Additionally, we will explore job role-specific trends and other significant observations within the dataset.

## Key Deliverables
1. **Identification of Key Factors**: Using statistical analysis and visualization techniques in R, we will determine the primary drivers of employee turnover.
2. **Job Role Insights**: We will analyze job roles to uncover trends, such as variations in job satisfaction across different positions.
3. **Predictive Modeling**: We will build a predictive model to forecast attrition, allowing DDSAnalytics to proactively address potential turnover issues.

## Methodology
Our analysis will include:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure quality inputs.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and correlations.
- Feature engineering, if necessary, to enhance model performance.
- Statistical testing and visualizations to validate findings.
- Model selection and evaluation using appropriate metrics.

## Expected Outcomes
This project aims to provide Frito Lay with actionable insights into employee turnover, empowering the organization to implement targeted interventions to retain talent. By understanding the underlying factors driving attrition and leveraging predictive analytics, Frito Lay can enhance its talent management strategies and support its clients in fostering a more stable workforce.

## Final Outcomes
The project's final analysis and deliverable are found in the file, "Case Study Final.pptx" with the prediction model found in "CaseStudy1.Rmd". More details about the process, including the EDA, are included in the EDA folder.
